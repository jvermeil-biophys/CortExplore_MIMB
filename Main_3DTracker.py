# DESCRIPTION
# bead type                 : text
#                             Identify the bead type. Default is M450.
# 
# bead diameter             : int
#                             Identify the bead diameter in nm. Need to be determined 
#                             from a calibration for each new batch of beads.
# 
# normal field              : float
#                             Uniform magnetic field applied to the chamber during 
#                             the experiment, in mT. It is the *target* field. 
#                             The actual field applied one might differ: see next parameter.
# 
# magnetic field correction : float
#                             Corrective multiplicative coefficient to 'normal field' 
#                             to take into account the actual magnetic field of the experiment. 
#                             Example: one does an experiment with a "target" constant field at 5 mT. 
#                             At the end of the experiment, one measures with a gaussmeter 
#                             than the field was actually 5.1 mT. The 'magnetic field correction' 
#                             will be 5.1 / 5 = 1.02.
# 
# multi images              : int
#                             Number of Z-planes acquired per timepoint. Acquiring 
#                             several Z-planes per timepoint increase the precision of Z-detection.
#                             Default is 3.
# 
# multi image Z step        : int
#                             Step in Z between each Z-planes if multi-image > 1, in nm.
#                             Default is 500.
# 
# multi image Z direction   : text
#                             Direction of the scan when acquiring several Z-planes 
#                             per timepoint. Needs to be 'upward' or 'downward'.
#                             Default is 'upward'.
# 
# scale pixel per um        : float
#                             Scale of the objective in pixel per micron. 
#                             Proceeding to a manual calibration when using 
#                             a new microscope is very strongly recommended.
# 
# optical index correction  : float
#                             Ratio of the optical index of the cell medium over 
#                             the index of the immersion liquid. Crucial for Z-distances 
#                             computation. When using an oil-objective and typical DMEM, 
#                             optical index correction = 1.33/1.52 = 0.875. When using 
#                             an air-objective and typical DMEM, optical index correction = 1.33/1.00 = 1.33.

# %% 4. Additionnal options

dictOptions = {'redoAllSteps' : False, 
               'timepoints' : True
              }

# =============================================================================
# DESCRIPTION
# redoAllSteps              : bool, default is False.
#                             If False, the programm will use intermediate outputs 
#                             to skip steps that would have already been performed, thus saving time
#                             (for instance if you reanalyze a given movie for the second time).
#                             If True, the programm will ignore these intermediate outputs and perform the full analysis.
# 
# timepoints                : bool, default is True.
#                             If True, the programm will expect a "_Timepoints.txt" text file,
#                             containing a single column of time points in ms, corresponding to every frame in the image file. 
#                             This time column will be used to generate the results.
#                             If False, the program will bypass this by generating a mock time column, 
#                             with integers from 1 to N, N being the number of frames.
