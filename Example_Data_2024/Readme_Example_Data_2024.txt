This is a minimal dataset to run the analysis script CortExplore_MIMB.

1) Content
The folders of this dataset are the following:
- 01_Timelapses: Contains the film of a cell (3T3 fibroblast) with the Magnetic Pincher, and the associated files. 
	* The main image file, in .tif format, is a succession of short Z-stacks of the cell. Each Z-stack is made of 3 images, going downward with a step of 0.5 µm in 50 ms. The duration between two successive Z-stack is 500 ms. For more explanations, refers to the MIMB paper. 
	* The "_Timepoints.txt" text file contains a single column of timepoints in ms, corresponding to every frame in the image file. 
	* The "_Results.txt" file contains the positions of the beads in every frame as detected with a Fiji routine, detailed in the MIMB paper. New users are invited to try to reproduce this file by themselves using Fiji.
	* The "_LogPY.txt" file is a intermediate file generated by the python program. Among other roles, it records the user manual inputs so that a given image can be re-analysed several times without having to re-do the manual input every time.

- 02_ZScans: Contains vertical scans of beads used for the Magnetic Pincher (Dynabeads M450). These stacks were made on the same day than the example timelapse, to ensure that the imaging conditions are exactly the same for both. They consists in 401 images, ranging from the bead equatorial plane to 8µm below, with 20nm step. The brightest light spot below the bead is obtained roughly in the middle of the stack. Each of these stack is associated with a "_Results.txt" file obtained as explained in the MIMB paper.

- 03_Depthograph: Empty folder, where the new user is expected to save the depthograph created from the ZStacks in the previous folder.

- 04_Results: Empty folder, where the new user is expected to save the results of the bead tracking.

- The next two folders can be seen as the "solutions" of this example of analysis. When a new user attempt to use this test dataset for the first time, I suggest they compare their depthograph with the one in "101_Expected_Depthograph", and that they compare their results to the contents of "102_Expected_Results".

2) How to use
Follow these steps, using the MIMB method paper as an instruction guide (check the "Reference Material" folder):
2.1 - Using Fiji, inspect the .tif image in "01_Timelapses" and try to generate yourself the "_Results.txt". Then check that you obtained the same than the one already present.
2.2 - In your favorite python editor, open the script "Main_DepthoMaker.py" and use it to generate a depthograph from the files in "02_ZScans". Save the results in "03_Depthograph" and check their correctness by comparing with "101_Expected_Depthograph".
2.3 - Open the script "Main_3DTracker.py" and use it to track the beads in the film. Save the results in "04_Results" and check their correctness by comparing with "102_Expected_Results".
